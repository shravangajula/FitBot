# üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è FitBot: An AI-Powered Fitness Assistant

## üîç Overview

**FitBot** is an intelligent, conversational fitness assistant built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture. It combines the power of **semantic vector search**, **agent-based query routing**, and **LLMs (GPT-4)** to deliver personalized responses on workouts, nutrition, and healthy lifestyle guidance.

This project leverages cutting-edge NLP tools and vector databases to minimize hallucination, maintain grounded answers, and scale across various health domains. Built for fitness enthusiasts, FitBot aims to be your always-available digital trainer and wellness guide.

## **Key Features**

### 1. **Streamlit-Based User Interface**
- **Conversational-Fitness Chatbot**: Users interact via a friendly chatbot interface to get guidance on workouts and nutrition.
- **Intuitive Layout**: Chat history is displayed clearly, enabling smooth and contextual interaction for ongoing health tracking.

### 2. **Document Preprocessing with PyPDF**
- Extracts and preprocesses data from fitness and nutrition related document (PDF).
- Converts extracted data into regex(text formatting) for further embedding and fine-tuning.

### 3. **Embedding Generation**
- Breaks down large documents into semantically meaningful chunks.
- Uses OpenAI and Hugging Face models to convert text into embeddings for efficient retrieval.

### 4. **Chroma Vector Database**
- Stores vectorized data in ChromaDB for quick access to relevant fitness content.
- Provides fast retrieval of relevant fitness related documents during a query.

### 5. **LangChain for Document Retrieval**
- Directs user queries to the correct data sources, be it workout plans, nutrition info.
- Provides contextual information for personalized responses.

### 6. **Fine-Tuned LLM**
- GPT-4 fine-tuned on domain-specific fitness and nutritional data.
- Generates detailed, conversational responses tailored to the user‚Äôs input.
